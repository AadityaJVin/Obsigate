# WAFinity - Infinite Protection, Intelligent Detection

**WAFinity** is an Advanced Web Application Firewall (WAF) that protects web applications from known threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other similar attacks by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between the application and the Internet.

In addition to signature-based detection, it uses **machine learning-based anomaly detection** to identify obfuscated, zero-day, and previously unknown attacks by analyzing patterns and behaviors in incoming requests.
