## üí° Motivation
Obsigate is designed to explore **hybrid web security**, combining signature-based detection and AI/ML anomaly detection.  
The project demonstrates how to **protect modern web applications** against both known attacks and obfuscated or zero-day threats while learning about WAFs, feature extraction, and ML-based security.

---

## 1. Introduction
Obsigate is a hybrid **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** that combines:  

* **Signature-based detection** for known attacks.  
* **Machine Learning-based anomaly detection** for obfuscated or zero-day threats.  

This layered approach enhances security against both traditional exploits and sophisticated encoded payloads.

---

## 2. Hybrid Detection Architecture
Obsigate operates in **two stages**:

1. **Stage 1 ‚Äì Signature Detection**  
   - Matches incoming requests against predefined attack patterns.  
   - Detects SQLi, XSS, path traversal, and other common exploits.  

2. **Stage 2 ‚Äì AI/ML Detection**  
   - Triggered when requests appear ‚Äúobfuscated‚Äù or suspicious.  
   - Uses a pre-trained **LightGBM model** to classify requests as *malicious (1)* or *valid (0)*.

## 3. Machine Learning Pipeline

### 3.1 Feature Extraction
Obsigate extracts **8 statistical features** from URI, GET, and POST data:

* `URI_Length` ‚Äì Length of URI  
* `GET_Length` ‚Äì Length of GET parameters  
* `POST_Length` ‚Äì Length of POST data  
* `URI_Entropy` ‚Äì Shannon entropy of URI  
* `GET_Entropy` ‚Äì Shannon entropy of GET data  
* `POST_Entropy` ‚Äì Shannon entropy of POST data  
* `Numeric_Text_Ratio` ‚Äì Digits-to-letters ratio  
* `Special_Char_Count` ‚Äì Count of special characters (`'`, `"`, `{`, `}`, etc.)  

### 3.2 Model Inference
* **Algorithm**: LightGBM  
* **Frameworks**: scikit-learn, joblib  
* **Model File**: `ml_model.pkl`  
* **Output**: Binary ‚Üí `0 = valid`, `1 = malicious`  

---

## 4. Model Training (Background)
The repository contains **inference code only**, not training scripts or datasets.  

**Training workflow (for reference):**
1. Collect labeled malicious + benign web requests.  
2. Extract features with `extract_features()`.  
3. Train LightGBM classifier.  
4. Validate with cross-validation.  
5. Save model ‚Üí `ml_model.pkl`.  

**Notes:**  
* Dataset should include thousands of examples for generalization.  
* Include various obfuscation encodings (URL, Base64, Hex).  
* Retrainable with new data for adaptive learning.  

---

## 5. Technical Implementation
* **Language**: Python  
* **Frameworks**: Flask, scikit-learn, LightGBM  
* **Inference**: `model.predict()` per suspicious request  
* **Model Storage**: Pre-trained model (`ml_model.pkl`)  
* **Feature Vector**: 8-dimensional per request  
* **Decision Output**: Binary classification (0=valid, 1=malicious)  

---

## 6. Key Benefits
* Detects **zero-day & obfuscated attacks**  
* **Low false positives** (ML runs only on suspicious requests)  
* **Retrainable** for evolving threats  
* **Fast inference** with lightweight features  
* Provides **adaptive learning** for modern attack patterns  

---

## 7. Deployment Notes
* Default Flask server is for **development only**.  
* For production, use **gunicorn** / **uWSGI**.  
* Logging and monitoring recommended to improve datasets.  
* Periodic retraining ensures protection against emerging threats.

## 9. How to Execute

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aaditya-2975/Obsigate.git
cd Obsigate
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
